# GAME OF LIFE

John Conway's proposed a gmae vit very easy rules:
1. - The game runs in an infinit grid of cells
2. - A cell can be dead or alive
3. - A dead chell will be alive in the next generation if it has three alive cells next to it
4. - An alive cell will be alive in the next generation if it hast two or three alive cells next to it

I allways found it kinda funny and i have done my own implementation, if you want to see it you can [click here](https://twikituki.github.io/GameOfLife/). You are allowed to change a cell state too by clicking on it and also you are allowed to pause execution by pressing space.
